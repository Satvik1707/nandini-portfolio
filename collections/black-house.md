The idea behind the project is to conceptually and practically design a 5500 sq.ft space keeping in mind the employees (45-50) and the needs of the brand “QUA”. It is a natural mineral water brand owned by The Narang Group. THE 3 KEYS OF QUA - REPLENISH, RENEW AND REPEAT

The space’s furnishings and colour scheme are intended to highlight the aesthetic appeal of the “Qua” brand. Since it is a water brand, the ocean concept has been interwoven into the aspect of every room. In terms of shapes and structures, the planning of the space has been based on the idea of islands. Natural elements have been incorporated into the design with the wellbeing of the staff in mind
