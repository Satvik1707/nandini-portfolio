Responsibility- Planning, Concept Design, 3D Modelling. The space is a contemporary, luxurious 150 sq. m. four-bedroom (converted to three) apartment in Vasant Vihar, Delhi, built for a couple and their newborn girl. An attempt has been made to visually and spatially engage the senses by using a splash of colour with the neutal colour palette.
