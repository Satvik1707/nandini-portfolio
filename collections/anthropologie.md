The space is a 56 sq. m. studio apartment designed for a 20 years old college student. The client is a social person who is inclined towards a space with elegance, modernity, and delightfulness.
According to studies, smooth-edged interiors make a space look more comforting and inviting. Since the space is for a college student living away from home, this residential space is based on the concept of curves and arches so that
the client easily adjusts to the place and feels at home. A 
color scheme of pink, white, black and gold has been
followed throughout the interiors to unify the spaces while 
accentuating their various edges and curves.
