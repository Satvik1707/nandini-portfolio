AASHRAY is a 4800 sq.m development care centre located in Mumbai for the children of sex workers in Mumbai, India. Its goal is to distance the child from the influences of the brothel at a very young age, allowing them to think clearly, develop emotionally and socially, and acquire new skills. The center will engage creativity and help develop cognitive skills through urban gardening.
