I am an interior designer based in Haryana, India. My expertise lies in interior space planning, conceptualizing, design development, and execution. I believe that design strategy starts with human experience. Everything I create is a reflection of what I sense, feel, and see in life and my travels around the world. The heart of my designs resonate with my innate style of class with color. My signature style is a modern aesthetic approach with luxury and minimalism.
